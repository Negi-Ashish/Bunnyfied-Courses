The Box component serves as a wrapper component for most of the CSS utility needs. Material UI for React has this component available for us and it is very easy to integrate.

As a CSS utility, the Box component also supports all system properties. You can use them as props directly on the component.

The Box component acts as a wrapper that allows you to apply various styling properties such as padding, margin, background color, and more. It is designed to simplify the process of creating responsive layouts and organizing content in a visually pleasing manner.
